**Welcome to MA563!** So what's this class about?

In this course we will investigate dynamical systems that exhibit "interesting" behavior, due to nonlinear dependence on parameters, or due to chaotic dynamics.

* [bifurcations](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bifurcation)
* [chaos in maps and ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)
* [statistical properties of dynamics](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/7/1907)

We will devote some time both to theory and to computational tools/methods that enable such analysis. The coursework will be heavy on homeworks and projects, but light on exams. There is no one textbook that covers all these topics (due to the piecewise-linear nature of the course), but we will lean heavily on (in the order of amount of material sourced from):

* [ASY] Alligood, Sauer, Yorke: "Chaos"
* [BIF] Kuznetsov: "Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory"
* [WIG] Wiggins: "Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos"
* [LM] Lasota, Mackey: "Chaos, Fractals, Noise"
* [BOLLT] Bollt, Santitissadeekorn: "Applied and Computational Measurable Dynamics"

I will provide you with handouts that cover the material in class, but I suggest that you buy the [ASY] textbook. It's an excellent introduction into dynamical systems, and can be found for $10-$20 used on <http://abebooks.com> and <http://amazon.com>. It's likely my favorite textbook on nonlinear dynamics.

Finally, you should really know what Jurassic Park has to do with dynamical systems...
