Due to COVID19 outbreak, Clarkson University is moving to online teaching starting with Mar 23, 2020. These are the updates to the syllabus and course delivery to ensure that objectives of the course are met.

To contact Marko during the remote work, in addition to e-mail <mbudisic@clarkson.edu> you can also use:

* [Google Calendar Appointments](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUluN09LQVpzc19pfGRlZmF1bHR8MTZiNjA4Y2EwMDJiNjQ4YWY0MDlhNzRhNmQ4YjVhZmU)
* [Zoom: 3152683742](https://clarkson.zoom.us/j/3152683742)
* [Skype: "live:marko_2842"](https://join.skype.com/invite/DTVIKsdy2gOu)


## Course delivery

In short, we'll have asynchronous (complete on your own schedule, ahead of the due date) and synchronous (real-time) components:

*   asynchronous: lecture PDFs and videos of lectures due to be watched ahead of our usual meeting time
*   asynchronous: short quiz after each lecture
*   synchronous: instead of lecture, I'll hold a 15 min check-in about the topic, followed by office hours on any topic you'd like to discuss for the remainder of the hour. _You will be asked to attend the synchronous session at least once per week (but I hope you can join every time)_.

## Submission of work and assessment

**Quiz**: Instead of one quiz per week (on Mon) worth 3 points, I'll have you complete three quizzes per week, each worth 1 point. The quizzes will be based on the lecture of the day, and for full credit, you're going to have to complete them correctly, and on time.

**Homework**: You will be required to submit a PDF of your work through Moodle submission system (I won't accept Overleaf links, or Google Drive/Dropbox shares, or e-mailed PDFs). Your homework can be handwritten, in which case you should plan to scan your work and combine all PDFs (including any simulation outputs) into one document. I will include my recommendations for some tools that accomplish this on a separate page.

**Project**: Reports will be due as usual. I will ask you to submit a draft 10 days before the end of the semester, for review, and then final report on the last day of class. If we are able to have in-person meetings after May 1, I expect us to have our in-person presentation for projects then. If we are still in social distancing after May 1, I would like to schedule a large Zoom meeting in which you will take turns to present your project to everyone. Depending on how the rest of the university will be handling the exams in such events, these plans may change.

**Midterm 2:** If we are still practicing social distancing, the Midterm 2 will be a take-home, open-book, open-notes exam with a 48 hour clock. This means that it will rely on computations and novel problems more than Midterm 1 did, but with the benefit of using resources that wouldn't be available during an in-class exam. I will discuss this around Apr 5 (approximately 10 days ahead of the midterm), when it will be clearer whether or not we will be staying in these extraordinary circumstances for the rest of the semester.

**Notetakers**: As long as we're in this remote-mode, I'll absolve the notetakers of any responsibility and grant them full tailored credit. If we go back to in-person classes, I'll ask you to contribute notes again. If you would personally prefer to keep posting notes, you are definitely welcome to do so and I will appreciate it. I do expect first 8 weeks of notes to be completed soon, though.

## Office hours and consultation

There will be **no in-person office hours**, **even if you and I are both on campus**, to comply with social distancing.

**Group video chat discussion:** During the usual lecture times, I will book a full hour only for this class. The primary topic will be the lesson of the day (that you will have watched the night before), but really anything is up for discussion.

We will be using Zoom, unless it proves unreliable due to high demand, in which case we'll adjust.

For an editable whiteboard, we will compare [https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/) and [https://www.bitpaper.io/](https://www.bitpaper.io/).

**Office hour slots:**

My [Google Calendar appointment page ](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUluN09LQVpzc19pfGRlZmF1bHR8MTZiNjA4Y2EwMDJiNjQ4YWY0MDlhNzRhNmQ4YjVhZmU)lists open appointment slots that you can book to discuss anything with me. I have a slight preference for the class-related matters (as opposed to research or advising) to go to slots labeled as MA563, but I am flexible on this.

Again, we'll be using editable whiteboard .

**Messages and communication**: To keep our inboxes from overflowing, I will switch to our Slack workspace almost completely for any kind of Q&A. Please ask your questions about the class publicly in one of the channels there (#homework-X or #office-hours or #projects) or via a personal message. If you send me an e-mail, you will receive my response directing you to post the same question into Slack, unless your question is somehow private and personal. For high-priority messages, I will post on Slack and Moodle. Please do keep some form of notifications on both platforms enabled so you don't miss my messages.

You can expect me to respond within a few hours daily during weekly work hours (8a-4p). I may sporadically be online during the weekends and in the evenings, but you shouldn't count on it (just because we're working from home, we - you or I - should not be expected to work 24/7). **If I haven't responded in 24 hours, please feel free to send another message.**

## Tips and Resources

Since these are challenging times to keep up our usual work productivity, I'll post some tips on what I am doing to stay on top of things. Please feel free to share with everyone on Slack anything special that works for you.

*   **scanning handwriting**: [MS Office Lens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-lens/9wzdncrfj3t8), [GeniusScan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan), -- make sure to save as black&white (or grayscale at worst) at no more than 150-200dpi, and use perspective correction. This will all keep the filesize down.
*   **collaborative/online MATLAB**: [matlab.mathworks.com](http://matlab.mathworks.com) -- create Mathworks account with your clarkson.edu address to get the full set of packages
*   if you were thinking about investing into a drawing tablet/smartscreen tablet/touchscreen laptop, now could be a great time. In particular [drawing tablets](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=drawing+tablet) are very affordable ($30-$75) and although they don't have a screen, can be used very effectively.
*   For **collaborating in real-time**, use MS Whiteboard [whiteboard.microsoft.com](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/) , [https://www.bitpaper.io/](https://www.bitpaper.io/),  or other comparable service. If you are using Zoom at the same time, Share Screen->Whiteboard may be available (depending on the account).
*   **Get a precision stylus**, even if you're working on a phone. They are not very expensive, but reduce frustration while working.
*   **Monitor your work-hours**: I use a (free) time-tracking app getharvest.com just to see how I spend my hours.
*   If you're not used to working from home, it can be a shock and a disaster. You can likely find your own tips, but here's a **useful website** to get you going: [https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-tips-working-from-home](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-tips-working-from-home)
